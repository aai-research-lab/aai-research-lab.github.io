Research Lab</strong>oratory for Computational Science. We are advancing research at the intersection of physics, chemistry, and biology, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI), mathematical, and computational tools to address some of the most challenging questions in biomedicine and biotechnology. Join us in this exciting frontier of computational science and be a part of revolutionizing the future of healthcare!</p> <h3 id="research">Research</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Biophysics:</strong> We study the physical laws that govern biomolecular interactions, using computer simulations to understand the dynamic behavior of proteins and other biomolecules.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protein Design:</strong> We work on engineering and designing proteins, immunogens, and antibodies with enhanced or entirely new functions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drug Discovery:</strong> We apply cutting-edge computational strategies to accelerate drug discovery, identifying promising drug candidates and optimizing their efficacy and safety.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="our-vision">Our Vision</h4> <p>We believe in the transformative power of computational science to revolutionize the way we understand biology and develop new therapies. Our research doesn’t just stay in the lab—it has the potential to create real-world solutions that can change lives.</p> <h4 id="get-involved">Get Involved</h4> <p>Interested in joining our research efforts or collaborating with us? We are always eager to connect with bright minds, whether you’re a student, a researcher, or an industry professional. Together, we can make a difference.</p> <h4 id="stay-connected">Stay Connected</h4> <p>Follow our lab’s journey, explore our publications, and stay updated on our latest discoveries. You can connect with us on <a href="https://linkedin.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>, and other platforms to engage with our research and network with the team.</p> <p>Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite <a href="http://reddit.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">subreddit</a>. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prof_pic.jpg</code> and put it in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">img/</code> folder.</p> <p>Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profile</code> property of the YAML header of your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_pages/about.md</code>. Edit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_bibliography/papers.bib</code> and Jekyll will render your <a href="/al-folio/publications/">publications page</a> automatically.</p> <p>Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Font Awesome icons</a> and <a href="https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Academicons</a>, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.</p> </body></html>
