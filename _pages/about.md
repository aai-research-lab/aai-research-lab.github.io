##### **[Adekunle Aina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ainaadekunle)**,Ph.D. | Lead Scientist


Welcome to A.A. Research Laboratory for Computational Science. We are advancing research at the intersection of physics, chemistry, and biology, harnessing the power of mathematical, and computational tools to address some of the most challenging questions in biomedicine and biotechnology. Join us in this exciting frontier of computational science and be a part of revolutionizing the future of healthcare!


### Research

**Biophysics --** We study the physical laws that govern biomolecular interactions and develop/use computational and machine learning methods to understand the dynamic behavior of proteins.

**Protein Design --** We utilize biophysical understanding to design and engineer novel proteins with entirely new structural and functional properties.

**Drug Discovery --** We apply protein design to immunogen and antibody design to tackle practical problems in drug discovery for neurodegenerative diseases.


We believe in the transformative power of computational science to revolutionize the way we understand biology and develop new therapies. Our research doesn’t just stay in the lab—it has the potential to create real-world solutions that can change lives.
