**Welcome to Dr. Aina, new Physics faculty member!**


---

Hi all:

Please join me in welcoming Dr. Adekunle Aina to the CSUDH Physics Department! Dr. Aina comes to us from Okanagan College in Kelowna, Canada, where he served as an instructor in Mathematics and Statistics. He is joining Dr. Crogman in our newly-formed Biophysics major, which I am sure will soon take the University by storm.

Dr. Aina received his Associate of Science degree in Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry from Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Nigeria, and his Bachelor of Science degree in Applied/Engineering Physics from the University of Lagos in Lagos, Nigeria. He then moved to Canada, receiving his Master of Science degree in Physics from the University of Newfoundland in Newfoundland, Canada, and his Ph.D. In Physics and Biophysics from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. He received his Ph.D. in 2023.

Side note: UBC is also the home of TRIUMF, a particle accelerator where I performed my first published physics experiment as an undergraduate way back in 1985.  Yes, I'm old. Back to Dr. Aina...

Dr. Aina did his doctoral dissertation on "Computational Modeling and Design of Oligomer Selective Immunogens for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease". It's available online, but I'll let you search for it yourself â€“ it's not that hard to find.

Dr. Aina has performed research in Computational Physics and Biophysics, Bioinformatics, and Data Science. He brings with him a wealth of knowledge and experience in the field, and I am confident that he will be a tremendous addition to the Physics Department.

As we begin the new semester, please take a moment to stop by his office and say hi, and welcome into our community.
